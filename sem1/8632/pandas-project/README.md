<h1>Analysis of the Iris data set. </h1>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The <em>Iris</em> dataset is a classic dataset, commonly used in Machine Learning and Statistics, to illustrate examples relating to Correlation, Classification and Regression. </p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The <em>Iris</em> dataset, otherwise known as <bf>Fisher's</bf> <em>Iris</em> dataset is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper
<em>The use of multiple meausurements in taxonomic problems</em> as an example of linear discriminant analysis. </p>

<h1>The Dataset</h1>
The dataset contains measurements of four features of iris flowers:
<ul>
    <li>Sepal length</li>
    <li>Sepal width</li>
    <li>Petal length</li>
    <li>Petal width</li>
</ul>

<p>The dataset also contains the species of iris for each reading. </p>
